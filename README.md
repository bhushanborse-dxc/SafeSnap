# 🚨 SOS App – Emergency Video & Location Alert System

The **SOS App** is a safety-focused mobile application designed to assist users during emergency situations. With a single tap of the **SOS button**, the app captures a short video, gathers the user's real-time location, and instantly notifies pre-configured emergency contacts via email or in-app messages.
